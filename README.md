This is a demonstration of a load cell based "Kitchen Scale" using a Bluetooth Low Energy link to an Android application running on a tablet.  This application is based on the Avia hx711 Load cell amplifier IC using a modified library with median filtering (included - https://github.com/CalPlug/Espressif_ESP32-Scale/tree/master/libraries/Hx711EXT). The Android applicaion provides display of weight, tare, and 2-point calibration functions.  All ESP32 and Android code is available in this reposititory.
